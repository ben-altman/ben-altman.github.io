I am already comfortable not knowing things.

My background is in music, which is a problem-solver's art. I haven't mastered a particular technique. I don't know any music by this composer. How do I get that particular sound? How can my chamber group reconcile different interpretive ideas? How do I need to structure my time to learn this music by this deadline? How can I make this work on my instrument?

And then there is the teaching. What does this student need? Need to know, need to be and ready to be exposed to? How can they be motivated? What is a better way to explain this concept? 

And I like to make things. 

An arrangement of a piano or orchestra work for solo guitar. An interpretation of a piece, considered from the ground up and presented to an audience for consumption. An exercise to help myself and my students improve. A single sound, the right one for the situation, that I can get consistently when I want it. 

So far, this has been my experience of coding. Figuring out how things work, how to read and interpret, how to solve a new kind of problem. And how to make something that works and does what I ask. 

This is why I came to coding, and so far, I have found what I was looking for.
