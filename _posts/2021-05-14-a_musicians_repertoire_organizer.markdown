This little Sinatra application allows the user to keep track of the musical works in their repertoire, and view them by period and type. This is a necessary task in my other life. I have a repertoire list posted on promotional websites, and when selecting a performance program I can build a themed concert, or just a varied and interesting concert of music. It is also helpful for study and reflection - are there any gaps in my repertoire or areas of interest that I have yet to explore?

I quickly generated a basic architecture for my app using the [Corneal](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal) gem.
